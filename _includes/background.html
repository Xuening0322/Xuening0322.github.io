      I blend coding with creativity to build cool stuff and make music with AI 🎵.

  Exploring the tech world at Cornell, I'm all about designing AI-powered solutions that make a difference. My background mixes full-stack development, machine learning, and music tech, and I’m excited to create cool, innovative products that bring my skills and passions together. I play piano and drink coffee when I’m not coding, and you’ll often find me wandering through random record shops in NYC 🎧 🚶‍♀️.</p>
