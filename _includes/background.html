      I am a master's student at <a class="underline-link" href="http://www.tech.cornell.edu/" target="_blank">Cornell University</a>, majoring in <a class="underline-link" href="https://tech.cornell.edu/programs/masters-programs/jacobs-technion-cornell-dual-ms-connective-media/" target="_blank">Information Systems</a>. I graduated from <a class="underline-link" href="http://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/" target="_blank">Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University</a> in July 2023 with First Class Honors.

  <p>
      During my undergraduate studies, I completed two internships in software engineering and machine learning engineering. In these roles, I served as a full-stack developer and tackled computer vision tasks, further solidifying my foundation in these areas.

      <strong>Music Technology</strong> is another field I am deeply passionate about. As a piano player and songwriter, I explored the realm of generative AI music during my undergraduate years. My work primarily centered on automatic music generation, combining elements of machine learning, music theory, natural language processing, and signal processing.

  <p>
      With a strong foundation in <strong>software engineering</strong> and <strong>machine learning engineering</strong>, my goal is to design AI-powered products that address real-world challenges.
