      I am a master's student at <a class="underline-link" href="http://www.tech.cornell.edu/" target="_blank">Cornell University</a>, majoring in <a class="underline-link" href="https://tech.cornell.edu/programs/masters-programs/jacobs-technion-cornell-dual-ms-connective-media/" target="_blank">Information Systems</a>. I graduated from <a class="underline-link" href="http://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/" target="_blank">Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University</a> in July 2023 with First Class Honors.

<p>
  My interests mainly focus on full-stack development and applied machine learning, with experiences in various <strong>computer vision</strong> and <strong>natural language processing</strong> tasks.
  </p>
<p>
  As a piano player and songwriter, I explored the realm of <strong>music tech</strong> during my undergrad. My work mainly focused on <strong>automatic music generation</strong>, the intersection of generative AI, music theory, and acoustics. I also engineered AI-powered solutions for real-word <strong>music information retrieval</strong> tasks.
</p>

<p>
  With a strong foundation in <strong>software engineering</strong> and <strong>machine learning engineering</strong>, my goal is to design AI-powered products that address real-world challenges.
