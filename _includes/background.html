<p>
  With a strong foundation in <strong>software engineering</strong> and <strong>machine learning engineering</strong>, my goal is to design AI-powered products that address real-world challenges. Leveraging this unique blend of technical skills and artistic passion, I am eager to contribute to innovative projects that bridge the gap between technology and art.
