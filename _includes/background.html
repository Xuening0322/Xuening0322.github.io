<p>
  My interests mainly focus on full-stack development and applied machine learning, with experiences in various computer vision and natural language processing tasks.
  </p>
<p>
  As a piano player and songwriter, I explored the realm of <strong>Music Technology</strong> during my undergraduate years. My work primarily focused on AI music generation, the intersection of music theory, natural language processing, and acoustics. I also engineered AI-powered solutions for music composition and music information retrieval in real-word scenarios.

<p>
  With a strong foundation in <strong>software engineering</strong> and <strong>machine learning engineering</strong>, my goal is to design AI-powered products that address real-world challenges.
